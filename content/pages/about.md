The Purdue Linux Users Group (PLUG) is a Free/Open Source Software
enthusiast club that was founded in 1994.  Members are interested in not just Linux, but also
BSD, Mac OSX, and other software that is Free/Open Source in whole or in
part.  Our meetings generally consist of social gatherings where we get
together and talk tech, presentations by members or outside parties,
expositions to the public at large, etc.
