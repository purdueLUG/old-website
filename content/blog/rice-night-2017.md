We'll be having a Rice Night **Tuesday, November 14th** at **6PM** in **REC 108**. In case you're unaware, Ricing is basically just slang for making your desktop look pretty. Themes, minimalist guis, window managers, terminals, and cool status bars are all fair game. It should be a lot of fun; hope to see y'all there!
