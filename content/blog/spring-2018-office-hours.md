Our new office hours for the spring have been posted on the [Getting Help](/getting-help.html) page. You can find at these times in the basement of the Lawson Computer Science building, room B128.

Feel free to stop in for a quick Linux or general programming question. Even if we can't directly answer your question, we'll likely be able to point you in the right direction!
